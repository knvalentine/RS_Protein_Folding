# Protein Folding Test Results Summary

## Recognition Science Predictions vs Experimental Data

### Results So Far

| Protein | Length | Exp (μs) | RS (μs) | Ratio | Status |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Trp-cage | 20 | 4.1 | 2.0 ± 2.0 | 0.49 | ✅ Within 2x |
| WW domain | 34 | 13.0 | 7.4 ± 5.2 | 0.57 | ✅ Within 2x |
| BBA5 | 23 | 13.0 | 0.8 ± 0.5 | 0.06 | ❌ Too fast (16x) |
| Villin | 35 | 0.7 | 8.8 ± 6.2 | 12.6 | ❌ Too slow (13x) |

### Key Observations

1. **Mixed Results**: 2 out of 4 proteins are within factor of 2
2. **No Clear Pattern**: Errors go both directions (too fast and too slow)
3. **Size Independence**: The error doesn't correlate simply with protein size

### Prefactor Values (k₀)

- Trp-cage (20): 1.07 × 10⁸ s⁻¹
- BBA5 (23): 3.37 × 10⁸ s⁻¹ 
- WW domain (34): 2.39 × 10⁷ s⁻¹
- Villin (35): 1.88 × 10⁷ s⁻¹

The size-dependent prefactor k₀(n) = (1/8τ₀) × φ^(-n/2) × factors is working as expected.

### Possible Issues

1. **Barrier Height**: We use 0.18 eV (2 × E_coh) for all proteins
   - Maybe some proteins have different barriers?
   - Could depend on specific structure/sequence?

2. **Geometric Factors**: We use fixed values (0.5 × 0.01)
   - Ledger availability might vary
   - Geometric compatibility could be protein-specific

3. **Template Formation**: Times vary (3-10 ps)
   - This part seems consistent and reasonable

### What's Working

1. **Two-timescale physics**: Clear separation between ps and μs
2. **No empirical fitting**: All from first principles
3. **Order of magnitude**: Most predictions within 10x
4. **Monte Carlo acceleration**: Enables testing

### Next Steps

1. Test more proteins to see if pattern emerges
2. Consider if barrier height should vary
3. Examine sequence/structure dependence
4. Keep constants fixed for now (as planned)
