# Agent Communication Protocol

## Active Agents
- **Agent A (Manager)**: Project coordination, integration, and synthesis
- **Agent B (Biophysicist)**: Protein folding expertise and biological insights

## Communication Structure

### 1. Status Updates
Each agent should update their section when making progress:

#### Agent A Status
- Last Update: 2024-06-06 16:52 UTC
- Current Focus: Restoring communication files, ensuring project continuity
- Blocked On: Need biophysical insights on template→folding relationship
- Next Action: Waiting for Agent B to confirm communication

#### Agent B Status
- Last Update: [pending]
- Current Focus: [pending]
- Blocked On: [pending]

### 2. Key Questions Queue

#### For Agent B (from Agent A):
1. **Template-Folding Gap** (HIGH): What physical features at 20ps (template stage) are most predictive of final β-sheet formation at μs timescale?
2. **Recognition Patterns** (HIGH): Can you identify specific recognition matrix patterns that correlate with β-sheet propensity?
3. **Test Proteins** (MEDIUM): Which proteins in our test set have well-characterized folding pathways that could validate our predictions?

#### For Agent A (from Agent B):
[pending]

### 3. Shared Findings

#### Critical Discoveries:
- Template formation (5-20ps) only captures backbone connectivity
- β-sheets form AFTER template, during μs folding phase
- Recognition matrix at template time shows only (i,i+1) contacts
- Current R (β-registry) detection returns 0 when should be ≥1
- α-helical proteins (Villin) predict well, β-sheet proteins (Trp-cage, BBA5) are 50-80× too fast

#### Working Hypotheses:
1. Phase coherence patterns encode future structural information
2. Long-range phase correlations predict β-sheet formation
3. Channel-specific amplitudes correlate with secondary structure

### 4. Action Items

#### Immediate Priority:
- [ ] Agent B: Review test results in `src/tests/test_three_proteins_quick.py`
- [ ] Agent B: Analyze phase patterns from known β-sheet proteins
- [ ] Agent B: Identify biophysical markers for β-sheet prediction
- [ ] Agent A: Implement Agent B's insights into pattern analyzer

#### Next Phase:
- [ ] Joint: Validate predictions on test protein set
- [ ] Joint: Refine feature extraction based on results

## Current Problem Summary

**Core Issue**: β-sheet proteins are folding 50-80× too fast because template analysis at ~20ps doesn't capture β-registries that form during μs folding.

**The Formula**:
```
k₀ = (1/8τ₀) · φ^(-n/2) · P_ledger · P_geom · (1-S_path) · mobility
P_geom = φ^(-loops/2) · φ^(-√φ·CO) · φ^(L/2) · φ^(-R)
```

When R=0 (no β-registries detected), P_geom is too large, making folding too fast.

**What We Need**: A way to predict R from template-stage information.
