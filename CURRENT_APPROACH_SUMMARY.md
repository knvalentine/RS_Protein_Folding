# Current Approach Summary

## What We're Doing

### 1. Two-Stage Process
```
Template Formation (5-20 ps) → Monte Carlo Folding (μs)
     ↓                              ↓
Extract Parameters              Apply Arrhenius
     ↓                              ↓
  k₀, P_geom                  k_fold = k₀·exp(-0.18eV/kT)
```

### 2. Parameter Extraction from Template
We analyze the template to get:
- **Loops**: Independent cycles in voxel graph
- **Contact Order**: Average sequence separation of contacts
- **L (helix axes)**: Number of helix segments ≥6 residues
- **R (β-registries)**: Number of β-sheet ladder patterns

### 3. The Formula
```
k₀ = (1/8τ₀) · φ^(-n/2) · P_ledger · P_geom · (1-S_path) · mobility
P_geom = φ^(-loops/2) · φ^(-√φ·CO) · φ^(L/2) · φ^(-R)
```

## Where We're Stuck

### The Problem
At template time (20ps):
- Recognition matrix shows only backbone contacts: (0,1), (1,2), (2,3)...
- No long-range contacts that would indicate β-sheets
- Therefore: R = 0 always
- Result: P_geom too large → k₀ too large → folding too fast

### What We've Tried
1. **Geometric detection**: Look for residues close in space → Still R=0
2. **Recognition-based**: Count recognition events between strands → Still R=0
3. **Torsion-based**: Use φ/ψ angles to identify sheet residues → Helps identify potential, but no actual registries

### The Key Insight
β-sheets form DURING folding (μs), not during template formation (ps). We're looking for something that doesn't exist yet!

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Full Simulation
Run the complete μs folding, then analyze. Correct but expensive.

### Option 2: Predictive Model
Use template features + sequence to predict final R. This is where we need Agent B's help!

### Option 3: Information Theory
Maybe the phase patterns contain encoded information about future β-sheets that we're not extracting properly.

## Questions for Agent B
1. What template-stage features correlate with β-sheet formation?
2. Can we predict β-propensity from backbone geometry at 20ps?
3. Are there known early indicators of β-sheet formation in real proteins?
