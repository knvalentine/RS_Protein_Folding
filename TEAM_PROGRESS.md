# RS Protein Folding Team Progress

## Problem Statement
β-sheet proteins are folding 50-80× too fast because template analysis at ~20ps doesn't capture β-registries that form during μs folding.

## Team Members
- **Agent A (Manager)**: Coordination and integration
- **Agent B (Biophysicist)**: Protein folding expertise  
- **Agent C (Computational Physicist)**: Algorithm development
- **Agent D (Information Theorist)**: Information extraction
- **Agent E (Structural Biologist)**: Validation and testing

## Current Understanding
1. Template formation (5-20ps) only captures backbone connectivity
2. Recognition matrix shows only (i,i+1) contacts at template time
3. β-sheets form AFTER template, during μs folding phase
4. Current R (β-registry) detection returns 0 when should be ≥1

## Action Items

### Immediate (Agent D + Agent B)
- [ ] Analyze phase pattern field for predictive features
- [ ] Identify correlations between template and final structure
- [ ] Determine minimal information needed for β prediction

### Next Phase (Agent C)
- [ ] Design targeted sampling for β-sheet formation
- [ ] Develop interpolation between template and folded states
- [ ] Create efficient algorithms for feature extraction

### Validation (Agent E)
- [ ] Curate test set with known folding pathways
- [ ] Validate predictions against experimental data
- [ ] Identify failure modes and edge cases

## Key Hypotheses to Test
1. Phase coherence patterns at template time encode future β-registries
2. Recognition matrix eigenvalues predict final topology
3. Channel-specific phase amplitudes correlate with secondary structure

## Success Metrics
- Predict folding times within 5× for all proteins
- Correctly identify number of β-registries (R) from template
- Maintain zero empirical parameters
