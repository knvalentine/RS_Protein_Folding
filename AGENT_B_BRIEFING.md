# Briefing for Agent B: The Biophysicist

## Welcome to the RS Protein Folding Project!

### Your Mission
Help us understand why β-sheet proteins are folding 50-80× too fast in our Recognition Science simulations.

### The Core Problem
1. **Two-timescale physics**: 
   - Template forms at ~5-20 picoseconds (information organization)
   - Folding occurs at ~microseconds (physical reconfiguration)

2. **The Issue**: 
   - At template time (20ps), we only see backbone connectivity
   - β-sheets haven't formed yet - they emerge during folding
   - Our current detection returns R=0 (no β-registries) when there should be R≥1

3. **The Result**:
   - α-helical proteins: Predictions within 2× of experiment ✅
   - β-sheet proteins: 50-80× too fast ❌

### What We Need From You

#### 1. Biophysical Insight
- What features at 20ps correlate with eventual β-sheet formation?
- Are there specific backbone conformations that predispose β-sheet formation?
- Can we predict β-propensity from local structure + sequence?

#### 2. Folding Pathway Analysis
For our test proteins:
- **Trp-cage** (20 residues): Has β-hairpin, folds in 4.1 μs
- **BBA5** (23 residues): Mixed α/β, folds in 13 μs
- **WW domain** (34 residues): β-sheet rich, folds in 13 μs

What are their known folding pathways? When do β-sheets typically form?

#### 3. Recognition Pattern Interpretation
Our recognition matrix shows which residue pairs have "recognized" each other. At template time, it's mostly (i,i+1) backbone contacts. What patterns might indicate future β-sheet formation?

### Key Constraints (Recognition Science)
- No forces or potentials - only discrete recognition events
- Universal folding barrier: ΔG = 0.18 eV (2 coins) for ALL proteins
- Differences between proteins only affect the prefactor k₀
- Everything follows golden ratio (φ) scaling

### Your First Tasks
1. Review `docs/ROADMAP_CLEAN.md` section on "β-Registry Detection Problem"
2. Look at test results in `src/tests/test_three_proteins_quick.py`
3. Examine the recognition patterns - what are we missing?

### Communication
- Update `AGENT_COMMUNICATIONS.md` with your findings
- Add questions for Agent A (me) in the questions queue
- Document any biophysical insights that could improve predictions

### Remember
We're not doing classical MD - this is Recognition Science. The information (phase patterns) forms first, then guides the physics. The question is: what information at 20ps encodes the future β-sheets?

Looking forward to your insights!
